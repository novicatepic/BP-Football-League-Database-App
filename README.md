A football league has its name (e.g., EPL) and a founding date, and it contains a corresponding number of teams. Each team has its name, founding date, and number of trophies won. Within the league, all played matches are recorded, as well as the number of matches played by each team, the number of wins, draws, losses, goals scored, goals conceded, and current season points. Matches are played at stadiums. Multiple teams can be hosts at one stadium, but each team can be the host at only one stadium during the season. Each stadium has a name, capacity, and city where it is located (assuming all teams are from one country).

Every team has staff members, including coaches, other staff (e.g., cleaning personnel, physiotherapists, etc.), and players. Players are identified by a number within the team and have statistics (goals scored, assists, yellow and red cards). Each staff member has a first name, last name, and hire date by the team.

The league has a fixed number of rounds, and each round records the matches played in that round. Additionally, each match is characterized by a result, the number of goals scored by the home team and the away team, the date of the match, and whether the team played at home or away.

Each match within the league can have external events, which may or may not occur (e.g., power outage, referee equipment issues, fan interruption, match interruption, player injury, weather conditions, etc.). Assistant referees record external events.

Within the league, there are referees, where each referee can officiate only in one national league, but there can be multiple referees within one league. Each referee is characterized by a first name, last name, years of refereeing, and the number of matches they have officiated. Each match has a team of four referees (main referee, two assistant referees, and a fourth official responsible for substitutions). Only one main referee can officiate a match (disregarding referee injuries), but one main referee can officiate multiple matches (the same applies to assistant referees and the fourth official). For simplicity, the fourth official cannot be the main referee.

Additionally, events are recorded for each player during the match, and each event has its description. For each player, match-specific statistics are kept, including goals scored in the match, assists, whether they received yellow or red cards, whether they started the match, and how many minutes they played.

Records are also kept for league winners, the season in which they won, and the name of the club that won the league at that time.
